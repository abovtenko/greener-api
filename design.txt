Greener API

	API Architecture
		Minimal (no controllers)
		 
		 The application that this api will serve is the main focus point. So choosing a path that allows the api itself to be built faster and with less code is preferred.
	
	ORM
		Dapper
	
	Database
		Postgres 
		
	REST
	
		This application will use resources, which is level 1 of RMM. The resources will be:
		
			/user
			
			/account
			
			/transaction
			
			/category
